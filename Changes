0.04 2012-09-04

  - Tree; fix path_by_indexes to not screw with the arrayref originally passed
    in; this was breaking Network if memoize => 1

  - Tree::Network; fix memoize/route preservation.

0.03 2012-09-03

  - Tree; add method path_by_indexes() for resolving names given a
    trace_indexes hop route.

  - Tree::Network;
    Trade back some memory for some CPU time in preserving routes;
    cache only their index-based route rather than hop names, walk 
    the route to fetch names via Tree->path_by_indexes()

  - Tree::Network; 'memoize => 0' in constructor will turn off route
    preservation.

  - Fix slightly malfunctioning constructor.

0.02 2012-09-02

  - Fix a syntax error in bin/irc-tree-repl
